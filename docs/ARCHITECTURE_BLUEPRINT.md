```

### Component Architecture
All pages share: Navigation, Footer, Scroll-to-top, Page transition overlay.
Components are embedded in HTML (no JS rendering) for:
- Zero FOUC on critical layout
- Full SEO crawlability
- Graceful degradation without JS

JavaScript enhances with: scroll animations, mobile menu, typing effects, form validation, counters.
